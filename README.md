# Overview
This is my version of a C++ library for producing fake/mock data for program testing. It is influenced by and uses configuration files from the Ruby Faker library found at https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker. No code was used from that library, but I did translate from some of their YAML data files. As such, I have included a copy of the Faker license.

# License
This software is open-source and governed by the MIT software license, a copy of which is in the LICENSE file. In addition, the JSON files used are pure translations from the faker-ruby/faker project, and that data is copyright from them. Their license is in LICENSE.faker-ruby.

I believe the MIT license is pretty open, but if you wish to apply a different open source license, you may apply the terminology of any license approved by the Open Source Initiative as long as they do not obligate me or add any legal liability to me. The code is provided as is without warrantee, and if use of the code results in someone dying, maybe you shouldn't have used a library that says "Faker" in it.
